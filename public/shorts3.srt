00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
...the time to start worrying about the future of our jobs has arrived.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
On March 18th, NVIDIA unveiled the Blackwell B200 Tensor Core chip.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The company's most powerful single chip GPU with 208 billion transistors.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
NVIDIA claims it can reduce AI inference operating costs such as running chat GPT and energy

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
consumption by up to 25 times compared to the H100,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
a chip they put into production two years ago.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The company also unveiled the GB200, a super chip that combines the B200 chips and the

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Grace CPU for even more performance.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The Blackwell platform will allow the training of trillion parameter AI models that will

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
make today's generative AI models look rudimentary in comparison.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:15,000
All in all...
